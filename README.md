# Steadybit extension-host

This [Steadybit](https://www.steadybit.com/) extension provides a host discovery and various actions for host targets.

Learn about the capabilities of this extension in our [Reliability Hub](https://hub.steadybit.com/extension/com.steadybit.extension_host).

## Configuration

| Environment Variable                                     | Helm value                         | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Required | Default |
|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|---------|
| `STEADYBIT_LABEL_<key>=<value>`                          |                                    | Environment variables starting with `STEADYBIT_LABEL_` will be added to discovered targets' attributes. <br>**Example:** `STEADYBIT_LABEL_TEAM=Fullfillment` adds to each discovered target the attribute `team=Fullfillment` | no       |         |
| `STEADYBIT_DISCOVERY_ENV_LIST`                           |                                    | List of environment variables to be evaluated and added to discovered targets' attributes. <br> **Example:** `STEADYBIT_DISCOVERY_ENV_LIST=STAGE` adds to each target the attribute `stage=<value of $STAGE>`                 | no       |         |
| `STEADYBIT_EXTENSION_DISCOVERY_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDES_HOST` | discovery.attributes.excludes.host | List of Target Attributes which will be excluded during discovery. Checked by key equality and supporting trailing "*"                                                                                                        | false    |         |

The extension supports all environment variables provided by [steadybit/extension-kit](https://github.com/steadybit/extension-kit#environment-variables).

When installed as linux package this configuration is in`/etc/steadybit/extension-host`.

## Needed capabilities

The capabilities needed by this extension are: (which are provided by the helm chart)

- `SYS_ADMIN`
- `SYS_RESOURCE`
- `SYS_BOOT`
- `NET_RAW`
- `SYS_TIME`
- `SYS_PTRACE`
- `KILL`
- `NET_ADMIN`

## Installation

### Kubernetes

Detailed information about agent and extension installation in kubernetes can also be found in
our [documentation](https://docs.steadybit.com/install-and-configure/install-agent/install-on-kubernetes).

#### Recommended (via agent helm chart)

All extensions provide a helm chart that is also integrated in the
[helm-chart](https://github.com/steadybit/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/steadybit-agent) of the agent.

The extension is installed by default when you install the agent.

You can provide additional values to configure this extension.

Additional configuration options can be found in
the [helm-chart](https://github.com/steadybit/extension-host/blob/main/charts/steadybit-extension-host/values.yaml) of the
extension.

#### Alternative (via own helm chart)

If you need more control, you can install the extension via its
dedicated [helm-chart](https://github.com/steadybit/extension-host/blob/main/charts/steadybit-extension-host).

```bash
helm repo add steadybit-extension-host https://steadybit.github.io/extension-host
helm repo update
helm upgrade steadybit-extension-host \
    --install \
    --wait \
    --timeout 5m0s \
    --create-namespace \
    --namespace steadybit-agent \
    steadybit-extension-host/steadybit-extension-host
```

### Linux Package

Please use
our [agent-linux.sh script](https://docs.steadybit.com/install-and-configure/install-agent/install-on-linux-hosts)
to install the extension on your Linux machine. The script will download the latest version of the extension and install
it using the package manager.

After installing, configure the extension by editing `/etc/steadybit/extension-host` and then restart the service.

## Extension registration

Make sure that the extension is registered with the agent. In most cases this is done automatically. Please refer to
the [documentation](https://docs.steadybit.com/install-and-configure/install-agent/extension-registration) for more
information about extension registration and how to verify.

## Security

We try to limit the access needed for the extension to the absolute minimum. So the extension itself can run as a
non-root user on a read-only root file-system and will, by default, if deployed using the provided helm chart.

In order to execute certain actions the extension needs extended capabilities, see details below.

### Resource Attacks

The resource attacks are starting processes in the target containers cgroup/namespaces using [runc (APL2.0)](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc) for this the following capabilities are needed: `CAP_SYS_CHROOT`, `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`, `CAP_SYS_PTRACE`, `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE`, `CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE`, `CAP_SETUID`, `CAP_SETGID`, `CAP_AUDIT_WRITE`, `CAP_KILL`.
These processes are executed with the root user, but are short-lived and terminated after the attack is finished.

The resource attacks optionally need `CAP_SYS_RESOURCE`. We'd recommend it to be used, otherwise the resource attacks are more likely to be oom-killed by the kernel and fail to carry out the attack.

Under the hood [stress-ng (GPL2.0)](https://github.com/ColinIanKing/stress-ng) is used to perform the stress attacks.
For the fill disk `dd` or `fallocate`  and [nsmount (MIT)](https://github.com/steadybit/nsmount) is used.
For the fill memory [memfill (MIT)](https://github.com/steadybit/memfill) is used.

All needed binaries are included in the extension container image.

### Network Attacks

The network attacks are starting processes in the target containers network namespaces using [runc (APL2.0)](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc) for this the following capabilities are needed: `CAP_NET_ADMIN`,  `CAP_SYS_CHROOT`, `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`, `CAP_SYS_PTRACE`, `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE`, `CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE`, `CAP_SETUID`, `CAP_SETGID`, `CAP_AUDIT_WRITE`, `CAP_KILL`.
These processes are executed with the root user, but are short-lived and terminated after the attack is finished.

Under the hood start `ip` or `tc` is used to reconfigure the network stack and `dig` is used in case the hostnames need to be resolved.

All needed binaries are included in the extension container image.

## Removing some of the capabilities in Kubernetes/Containers

In case you want to reduce the default capabilities of this extension, remove them from the helm values and use a custom image which doesn't set the capability on the executable.
A customer image can be built using the following Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/steadybit/extension-host:latest

USER root
RUN setcap 'cap_setuid,cap_sys_chroot,cap_setgid,cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin,cap_sys_admin,cap_dac_override,cap_sys_ptrace+eip' /extension
USER 10000

ENTRYPOINT ["/extension"]
```

## Version and Revision

The version and revision of the extension:
- are printed during the startup of the extension
- are added as a Docker label to the image
- are available via the `version.txt`/`revision.txt` files in the root of the image
